This project explores data from the Kentucky Quality of Climate and Safety Survey, which is given to students 
every year across public schools in Kentucky. I transformed / cleaned the data in PowerBI to exclude null survey results
and to narrow our view to only Boone County schools.

I have included the PowerBI file and some PDF copies of various filters in case the viewer does not wish to download the
PowerBI file. The actual PowerBI dashboard has interactive filters so the viewer can change the question number (1-27) and the 
school (within Boone County).
