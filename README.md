This project explores data from the Kentucky Quality of Climate and Safety Survey, which is given to students 
every year across public schools in Kentucky. I transformed / cleaned the data in PowerBI to exclude null survey results
and to narrow our view to only Boone County schools.

I have included the PowerBI file and some PDF copies of various filters in case the viewer does not wish to download the
PowerBI file. The actual PowerBI dashboard has interactive filters so the viewer can change the question number (1-27) and the 
school (within Boone County).

I focused on Conner High School because I previously worked there as a teacher. Here are some trends I noticed for Conner High School while exploring the data dashboard:
- Economically disadvantaged students are consistently in the top 3 demographics for disagreeing with survey questions.
- A large majority of students feel welcome in the classroom by teachers (89% agree or strongly agree - Question #3) and feel that adults at the school care about them (92% agree or strongly agree - Question #5)
- 48% of the African American students surveyed disagree or strongly disagree that "All students are treated the same if they break school rules" (Question #7)
- Female and male students have different perceptions on bullying / mean behavior in school (For example, 43% of females and 62% of males agree/ strongly agree with the statement,
 "Students being mean or hurtful to other students online (such as websites and apps) is NOT a problem for my school." Additionally, 53% of females and 72% of males agree/ strongly
agree with the statement, "Students being mean or hurtful to other students is NOT a problem for this school." (See image below for this question from the dashboard - Question #23 on the survey).
